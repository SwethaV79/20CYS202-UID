        <b> Goal setting Theory: </b>
<br>
<br>
        •	Setting goals helps trigger new behaviors, helps guides your focus and helps you sustain that momentum in life.<br>
        <br>

        •	Goal-setting theory helps us understand that setting goals are a conscious process and a very effective and efficient means when it comes to increasing
          productivity and motivation, especially in the workplace.<br>
          <br
 >
       • Goal setting theory goes beyond this assumption, telling us that our internal cognitive functions are equally important, if not more, when determining
         our behavior.<br>
         <br>

       •	In order for our conscious cognition to be effective, we must direct and orient our behavior toward the world.<br>
