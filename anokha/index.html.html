Anokha Techfest, the annual event of Amrita School of Engineering, Coimbatore provides an unique opportunity for students to
 participate in fun-filled and
 challenging events and workshops. The event throws open opportunities for 
students from all disciplines to challenge themselves and foster the “Can Do” attitude. 
One of the key highlights of the Anokha 2020 edition was the Green Anokha concept. It was so wonderful to see the students adopt
 and implement our Chancellor AMMA's idea of “Living in Harmony with Nature”.<br>
